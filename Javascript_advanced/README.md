\# Javascript\_advanced



This repository contains advanced JavaScript exercises covering closures, lexical scoping, asynchronous execution, binding, DOM manipulation, and callbacks.



\## Task List



0\. \*\*Lexical scoping and welcome message\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Function demonstrating lexical scoping with a nested function alerting a welcome message.



1\. \*\*Closure Scope Chain\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Demonstrates how closures retain access to variables in their outer scope.



2\. \*\*Closure\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Function returning a closure that remembers a passed argument for later use.



3\. \*\*Closure and loops\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Uses closures inside loops to remember each iterationâ€™s value.



4\. \*\*Complex Closure\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Functions like `addBy` and `divideBy` returning closures for repeated arithmetic operations.



5\. \*\*Changing DOM with closure\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Dynamically changes page styles using closures and buttons to switch themes.



6\. \*\*Private methods with closure\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Class with private variables and methods using closures to track state (e.g., student scores).



7\. \*\*Stack order and setTimeout\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Demonstrates JavaScript execution stack and asynchronous behavior with `setTimeout`.



8\. \*\*Stack order in functions\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Functions calling others while observing synchronous execution order.



9\. \*\*Prime numbers \& timing execution\*\*  

&nbsp;  - Counts prime numbers and measures execution time using `performance.now()`.



10\. \*\*Execution stack \& timing execution\*\*  

&nbsp;   - Executes a function multiple times and measures total execution time.



11\. \*\*Changing stack order using setTimeout\*\*  

&nbsp;   - Uses `setTimeout` to defer heavy computation to the end of the execution stack.



12\. \*\*Binding\*\*  

&nbsp;   - Binds object methods to ensure the correct `this` context.



13\. \*\*Binding + Closure\*\*  

&nbsp;   - Combines `bind` with closures to log personalized messages correctly.



14\. \*\*Simple callback\*\*  

&nbsp;   - Demonstrates callbacks by fetching data via `XMLHttpRequest` and passing it to a function that modifies the DOM.



\## How to Run

1\. Open the folder in a browser-compatible environment.

2\. Open the developer console to observe logs, alerts, and DOM changes.

3\. For AJAX tasks, run via a live server to handle CORS.



\## Requirements

\- Use only vanilla JavaScript.

\- Focus on closures, lexical scoping, asynchronous execution, binding, and callbacks.

\- Each file demonstrates a specific advanced JavaScript concept.
