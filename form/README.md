\## ✨ Features

\- \*\*Responsive Layout\*\*: Works across different screen sizes.

\- \*\*Semantic HTML5\*\*: Proper use of `section`, `article`, `header`, `footer`, `fieldset`, and `legend`.

\- \*\*Accessible Form\*\*:

&nbsp; - Labels connected to inputs with `for` and `id`.

&nbsp; - `fieldset` and `legend` for grouping form elements.

&nbsp; - Placeholder examples and helper text.

&nbsp; - Keyboard accessibility with `accesskey` attributes.

\- \*\*Form Validation\*\*:

&nbsp; - Custom patterns for first name, last name, email, and title.

&nbsp; - Required fields with live error and success states.

&nbsp; - Visual feedback with icons (✔ for valid, ✘ for invalid).

\- \*\*Interactive Search Form\*\* with smooth expand-on-focus animation.

\- \*\*Custom CSS Variables\*\* for easy theming (colors, font sizes, etc.).

\## 🛠️ Technologies Used

\- \*\*HTML5\*\* – semantic structure

\- \*\*CSS3\*\* – styling with variables, flexbox, transitions

\- \*\*No JavaScript\*\* – all interactions rely only on HTML and CSS
